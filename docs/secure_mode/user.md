# Using Secure Mode

- When Squash has been deployed in your cluster (see Secure Mode Admin documentation), you just need to update your `~/.squash/config.yaml` as follows.
```yaml
# Squash config file
secure_mode: true
```
- After you have set this value, you can use Squash in the same way as in the default mode.
